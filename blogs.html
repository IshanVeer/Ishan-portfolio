        <h2>UNCERTAINTY</h2>
        <div>Just after lockdown had begun in March 2020, I somehow started ignoring my academics as the structure of my life had been disturbed. Slowly days went by and I started consuming more content about tech, psychology and philosophy. Be it podcasts, youtube videos or life itself. Because of this long pause which the circumstances had given to my life, I had time to think about the direction in which I wish to take my life in. I slowly stopped doing architecture. Was it out of laziness? Maybe yes. But it did help me change my priorities. But this period also gave a large amount of uncertainty, which in return gave anxiety to me. And when anxiety hits we tend to choose easiest next option which is available in front of us. If we just slow down at this moment and think carefully then there is an immense sense of clarity that we are provided with. I was scared of taking up coding as I thought I will have to give 4 years again to learn computer science from scratch. As time went by I found many resources out which one is this Neogcamp to learn web development,and got the direction to aim for. So during the situation of uncertainty a hurried decision could bring more chaos in an already caused chaos,whereas a calm mind would give you an immense sense of clarity.</div>

        <h2>DISCIPLINE</h2>
        <div>What I figured out in this lockdown is that the concept of doing something for the sake of happiness is flawed. People tend to choose something which requires a certain amount of cognitive load. Photography, art, videography look fun and also is but the process of consistently thinking creatively is a tedious task. When Ideas we think about don't look as good as we imagined them to be, which usually is in the initial process, it gets frustrating and difficult.
            So if not happiness what should we aim for? First, we shouldn't be miserable doing that thing and second, it's consistency. I have understood the value of consistency through coding itself. At first everything felt very difficult and overwhelming but as you do it for more and more days, it for sure gets easier. So discipline is what is necessary for being consistent and from my experience discipline cannot be isolated for one domain or one part of life. It usually boils down to yourÂ  attitude and self control. So my advice would be start with something easier like working out daily or getting up at fixed time and that thing every single day. And then slowly increase the amount of things that you do.But start with that one thing and start it Today.</div>
